How To Use
==========
The files in this folder represent the various interesting configurations as described in the main README of the mod.

To use one of them, follow these steps:
- Copy the file (don't simply move it) to the folder above this one ("MCM\Settings")
- If it exists (it's okay if it doesn't), delete the existing "Portable Junk Recycler Mk 2.ini" file
- Rename the file you copied to "Portable Junk Recycler Mk 2.ini"
